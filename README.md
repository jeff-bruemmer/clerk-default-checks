| **Sexism**             | Words and phrases that are sexist, or that try not to be sexist and fail (like _mail person_ instead of _mail carrier_).                                               |
| **Skunked-terms**      | Words with controversial correct usage that are best avoided, as you'll likely nettle readers no matter how you employ the term.                                       |
